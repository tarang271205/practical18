Program: 18 Let us assume, teacher is supposed to allot seats based on the studentâ€™s names. You 
are requested to help teacher by creating a C program, for collecting the names of 5 
students and sort them in alphabetical order. 
Code: // Practical 18: Create Simple Sorting System For Student Name In Alphabetical Order. 
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <string.h> 
void main() 
{ 
    char name[50][100];//Here User Can Enter Maximum 50 Student Name And Each Name Has 
Maximum 100 Character. 
    char t[100] ; 
    int n,i,j; 
 
    printf("How Many Students Are There??::");//Taking Number Of Students. 
    scanf("%d",&n); 
    printf("Write Students Name Only:"); 
 
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)//This Loop Stands For Taking Students Name As Input From User. 
    { 
        scanf("%s",name[i]); 
        fflush(stdin); 
    } 
 
    for(i=0;i<(n-1);i++)//Here This Loop Stands For Sorting Students Name in Alphabetical Order. 
    { 
        for(j=i+1;j<n;j++) 
        {
           if(strcmp(name[i],name[j])>0) 
            { 
                strcpy(t,name[i]); 
                strcpy(name[i],name[j]); 
                strcpy(name[j],t); 
            } 
 
        } 
    } 
    printf("\n\n\nFinal Result\n\n\n"); 
    for(i=0;i<n;i++)// Here This Loop Stands For Final Result. 
    { 
        printf("%s\n",name[i]);// This Printf Stands For Print Every Sorted Name. 
    }
    printf("\n\n\n24ce032_TARANG");
}
